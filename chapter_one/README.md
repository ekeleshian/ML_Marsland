# Ch 1 Summary

## Why ML?
* by 2020, all of world's computers will store 40 zettabytes of data
* Right now, people are only exploiting less than 1% of all data
* human mind can't grasp complexity of numerical relationships when feature space is big
* computers do a lot of the dirty work of performing large-dimensioned calculations
* Pushes computers to *learn*, like generalize or search for the right answer, or cluster inputs that have something in common

## Types of ML
* How does the computer know whether or not it's getting better, and how does it know how to improve? -- all ML methods have different approaches to answer these questions:
    *  Learn via:  Generalize (i.e. supervised learning) vs. Search (i.e. reinforcement learning) vs. Cluster (i.e. unsupervised learning)

## Supervised Learning
*  Define the target: Classification (discrete,unique, mutually exclusive and sometimes mutually nonexclusive categories/labels) vs Regression (any measured real number)

### The Process
1) **Data Collection/Preparation:**  finding ways to collect difficult data, making sure data is clean with no significant errors or null values, determining the 'right' size (not too large where curse of dimenionsality becomes an issue, and not too small where generalization is improbable)
2) **Feature Selection:** choosing such features that are robust to noise and most useful for prediction
3) **Algorithm Selection**
4) **Parameter/Model Selection**
5) **Training**
6) **Evaluation**
